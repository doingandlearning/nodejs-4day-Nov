# What is Node.js?

Open source, free, cross-platform, JS on the server, event-driven, non-blocking, asynchronous, scalable

# Characteristics of Node

  <li v-click="2">Google Chrome V8 JavaScript Engine</li>
  <li v-click="3">Modules/Packages</li>
  <li v-click="4">Event Driven, Single-Threaded I/O Model</li>
</ul>

# Open up a terminal
Execute both of these commands to make sure that you have Node install properly.

```bash {all}
node -v
npm -v
```

All being well, you'll get a version number back.

For this course, anything over Node 12 should be fine (though I'll be using Node 14) and I'll be using npm version 6.14.15.

# Node on the command line

By the end of this section, you should be able to:
- Explore all possible Node and V8 command line flags
- Use key utility mode command line flags
- Understand an essential selection of operational command line flags

<!-- The Node.js platform is almost entirely represented by the node binary executable. In order to execute a JavaScript program we use: node app.js, where app.js is the program we wish to run. However, before we start running programs, letâ€™s explore some of the command line flags offered by the Node binary. -->
---

```bash
node --help
node --v8-options
node --check app.js
node --print
node --eval
node --require
node --stack-trace-limit
```

# Exercises (`Labs/01-introduction`)

1. In the labs folder, there is a file called `will-throw.js`. Run the file without any flags and then run with the appropriate flag to see the full call stack.

  > In the first case, there should only be ten stack frames in the error output. In the second, there should be significantly more.

2. There are two other files in the labs folder, `bad-syntax.js` and `correct-syntax.js`. Use the appropriate flag to check the syntax of each file.

  > There should be no output when checking `correct-syntax.js` and there should be a Syntax Error when checking the syntax of `bad-syntax.js`.
